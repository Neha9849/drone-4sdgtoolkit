## Learning Tools

**Africa Drone and Data Academy**

The African Drone and Data Academy (ADDA) aims to be a center of excellence that will equip African youth with necessary 21st-century skills while strengthening the drone ecosystem for more effective humanitarian and development response. 

The ADDA courses, developed by Virginia Tech (USA) with the Malawi University of Science and Technology (Malawi) as its local partner, combines theoretical and practical methodologies in making, testing, and flying drones. The curriculum allows young people to learn how to construct and pilot drones, to integrate them into a supply chain system and to analyze drone data. It follows UNICEF’s ‘Drones and Data for Good’ vision, focusing on the potential of technology to positively impact young people.
