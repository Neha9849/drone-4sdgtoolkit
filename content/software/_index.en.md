**“Use Open Source” and “Design for scale”**.

Using only Open Source is a key principle of UNICEF Innovation, and all of our investments in software and other products have reflected this.
The “Software” section is a curation of various drone software products from UNICEF Innovation cohort companies.

## Software

**Portable UTM** 

Portable UTM is an Open Source-based Unmanned Traffic Management System developed following NASA UAS Service Supplier Specification.  

- Humanitarian Purposes 
Drones have proven their importance in medicine delivery, disaster recovery, and public safety. Portable UTM could be deployed easily, enabling operations in these contexts and generating greater impact on vulnerable populations.  

- Commercial operations
Fulfilment of regulatory requirements and awareness of drone operations are critical for the safe and responsible integration of drones in society. Portable UTM is a transparent and Open Solution to be integrated by governments and commercial drone operators.

The Portable UTM platform provides real-time data sharing for airspace management, coordination and access for drone pilots in low-connectivity settings following NASA and Federal Aviation Authority standards.  

Local authorities can set no-fly zones for drones in order to perform aircraft flights where needed, thereafter on the platform drone owners can register as volunteers and be notified if needed and seamlessly take part in any operation authorities see fit. Multiple drones can perform SAR activities, simultaneously covering large areas in a short time span allowing for prompt response for the delivery of critical supplies like water and medicine to hard-to-reach areas.
