**Technical Guide**

**Use of Satellites or Drones for Imagery Collection**

**Introduction**

Today, aerial imagery is available from a variety of sources, including traditional satellites, nano satellites, manned and unmanned aircrafts, balloons, and kites. This imagery can benefit humanitarian organisations in programming implementation, resource planning, community studies, and disaster response. Previously, the process of developing maps from imagery was painstakingly slow and it required a great deal of time from highly technically skilled individuals to patch different formatted images together.
This decision making guide aims to take the acquired knowledge from UNICEF’s use of satellites and drones for imagery collection and provide a guide on the different technologies as well as when to use a particular mode over the other. 

**Decision-making matrix**

The following tables provide a fact sheet on satellite and drone technology. When used together it will enable any technical or administrative decision maker to come to a quick and informed decision on which technology is best for any imagery needs. 

**Satellite imagery specifications;**
