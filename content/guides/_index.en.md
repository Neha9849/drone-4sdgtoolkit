**“Reuse and Improve”**.

The global drone industry has been developing for decades and the lessons learned from various stakeholders can be a guide for future innovation.
UNICEF and several other stakeholders have made significant contributions to the global knowledge base of the technology and use of drones in the development and humanitarian contexts specifically.
The “Guides” section is a collection of case studies, annual reports, and action guides for achieving specific outcomes.

## Guides

**Technical Guide - The use of drones in humanitarian and development missions**

The use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) to support humanitarian and development operations must always consider the interests, perceptions and concerns of the people the mission aims to serve; and therefore should always adhere to the humanitarian imperative of doing no harm. Doing this will require assessment and mitigation of potential unintended consequences that UAS operations may have on affected communities and humanitarian action. UAS deployments in the humanitarian and development sector must observe the humanitarian ethical principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.

**Technical Guide – How to setup a humanitarian drone corridor**

A Humanitarian Drone Corridor is designed to provide a controlled land area and airspace for Government, the private sector, universities, and other partners to explore how drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), can help deliver services that benefit communities. Since 2015, UNICEF has invested in three (3) permanent Humanitarian Drone Corridors in Malawi, Kazakhstan, and Sierra Leone, and a temporary corridor during the drone vaccine delivery trials in Vanuatu.   

The corridors have shown leadership in piloting drone use cases in medical deliveries, emergency response mapping, education mapping, and other applications. This document aims to provide a blueprint for establishing a humanitarian drone corridor based on the lessons learnt in the existing UNICEF corridors.

**Technical Guide – Drones vs Satellite for Imagery Data**

Today, aerial imagery is available from a variety of sources, including traditional satellites, nano satellites, manned and unmanned aircrafts, balloons, and kites. This imagery can benefit humanitarian organisations in programme implementation, resource planning, community studies, and disaster response.  

Previously, the process of developing maps from imagery was painstakingly slow and it required a great deal of time from highly technically skilled individuals to patch differently formatted images together.

This decision making guide aims to take the acquired knowledge from UNICEF’s use of satellites and drones for imagery collection and provide a guide on the different technologies as well as when to use a particular mode over the other.
