**“Build for sustainability” and “Do no harm”**.

Drones operate in public airspace, which is a very sensitive environment.
This presents unique challenges and risks.
National Civil Aviation Authorities handle the management of public airspace with support from the International Civil Aviation Organization.
The “Regulations” section of the toolkit houses several international best practice documents for the safe management, monitoring and control of drone operations in public airspace.

## Regulation tools

### ICAO Model UAS Regulations

The ICAO Model UAS Regulations and companion Advisory Circulars (ACs) offer a template for Member States to implement or to supplement their existing UAS regulations. These regulations and ACs are intended to be a living document and will evolve as the industry matures, providing States and regulators with internationally harmonized material based on the latest developments. 

ICAO encourages States who have implemented UAS regulations to share their regulations with ICAO by providing a link or PDF file to RPAS@icao.int. The State's UAS Regulations will then be added to the repository of "Current State Regulations" located in the UAS Toolkit on ICAO's public website: https://www.icao.int/safety/UA/UASToolkit. As States enhance or expand their UAS regulations, they are urged to notify ICAO of these developments by providing a copy of their replacement UAS regulations. 

#### Go to https://www.icao.int/safety/UA/Pages/ICAO-Model-UAS-Regulations.aspx   

Navigate to the Model UAS Regulations page and download Part 101 and 102, as well as the companion advisory cirulars AC101-1, AC102-1, AC102-37, and Draft AC922-001. Use these documents as a framework to develop new National Civil Aviation UAS regulations.  

For technical feedback in drafting new national regulations according to the ICAO Model UAS framework please contact RPAS@icao.int and drones.ooi@unicef.org. (Subject to the availibility of technical specialists).
