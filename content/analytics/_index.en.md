**“Be Data Driven”**.

One of the main products that from drones is data;
data is key for impact assessment or decision-making.
The “Analytics” section of this toolkit centres on curating drone-related artificial intelligence and data products that inform decision-making.
Areas where these drone analytics tools are used include surveillance, research, operations, project management and impact evaluation.

## Bioverse Labs (Brazil): Using drones and AI to support the sustainability of the Amazonian ecosystem

At Bioverse Labs, the team uses drone imagery and machine learning to identify and map non-timber species of trees (e.g., chestnut, copaiba, and Brazil nuts)  in the Trombetas River basin in Para State in Northern Brazil. Bioverse aims to identify tree species that support food security and economic growth for the indegenious communities in the region. This methodology, and accompanying sustainable agro-forestry management plan will provide communities with a more direct connection to renewable income sources.

## qAira (Peru): Using drones to monitor air quality from illegal mining areas in Peru

The team at qAIRa aim to assess air quality in Madre de Dios, through the measurement of pollutants; increase air quality monitoring in rural areas; create awareness about the quality of the air people breathe and its effects on health.

According to the World Health Organization,  new data shows that 9 out of 10 people breathe air  ontaining high levels of pollutants with an estimated 7 million deaths every year from exposure to polluted air causing diseases such as respiratory infection, heart disease and pneumonia.

Our technological solutions are connected to the internet, withstand harsh environmental conditions and are cost-effective compared to traditional solutions because they perform monitoring in larger areas and in less time.

## Rentadrone (Chile): Using aerial thermal imagery and machine learning for clean energy and agriculture uses 

Rentadrone detects, classifies, and organizes errors and damaged modules in solar power panels using thermal aerial imagery to increase energy efficiency of solar power plants. Our team will also explore an alternate use-case of thermal imagery for agriculture and will collect and label aerial photos of crops which will be used to automatically detect diseases on crops. 

Using thermal aerial imagery, our team detects little defaults that are represented by hot spots in solar panels. These hotspots can make the solar plants less efficient resulting in less energy output. Throughout our development process we realized the same technologies can be applied to detecting diseases in crops.

## Portable UTM (Uraguay): An intelligent flight system to support real time data sharing for airspace management  and multiple drone operation coordination.

The Portable UTM platform provides real-time data sharing for airspace management, coordination and access for drone pilots in low-connectivity settings following NASA and Federal Aviation Authority standards.  

Local authorities can set no-fly zones for drones in order to perform aircraft flights where needed, thereafter on the platform drone owners can register as volunteers and be notified if needed and seamlessly take part in any operation authorities see fit. Multiple drones can perform SAR activities, simultaneously covering large areas in a short time span allowing for prompt response for the delivery of critical supplies like water and medicine to hard-to-reach areas.
