**Qaira**

**COUNTRY:** Peru 

**TECH AREA:** Drones

**PARTNERS & COLLABORATORS:** ACCA - Association for the Conservation of the Amazon Basin, Lima City Municipality

Project Description 
qAIRa aims to address the global problem of pollution by monitoring the quality of air. qAIRa has developed ‘Andean Drone’, a personalized hybrid drone (a plane with vertical take-off and landing) that carries a payload of air quality sensors including CO2, VOCs, particulate matter, H2S, CO, and SO2.  

Key Results
- Mapped 600 hectares using drones across 4 cities in Peru.
- Provided air quality information to 20,000 users where the air quality monitors are deployed, equipping them with information on the quality of air they breathe.
- Conducted an evaluation on the quality of air in the context of Covid-19 in partnership with the government of Lima City leading to recommendations for policy on clean energy alternatives.

**Rentadrone**

**COUNTRY:** Chile 

**PARTNERS & COLLABORATORS:** Photovoltaic Plant Quilapilun (Data collection)

Project Description  
Rentadrone detects, classifies and organizes the errors and damaged modules in Solar Power Plants using thermal imagery. The objective is to increase energy efficiency and improve performance of solar farms. The team also developed an agricultural use case, collecting and labelling aerial photos of crops which will be used to automatically detect diseases on crops.  

Key Results:  
- Rentadrone has mapped 178 hectares of agricultural land, generating 24 maps for their relevant clients.  
- Rentadrone has assessed 230,000 solar panels and found faults in 7150 panels increasing the efficiency of these clean energy alternatives
