      <description>“Be Data Driven”.
One of the main products that from drones is data; data is key for impact assessment or decision-making. The “Analytics” section of this toolkit centres on curating drone-related artificial intelligence and data products that inform decision-making. Areas where these drone analytics tools are used include surveillance, research, operations, project management and impact evaluation.

      <description>“Build for sustainability” and “Do no harm”.
Drones operate in public airspace, which is a very sensitive environment. This presents unique challenges and risks. National Civil Aviation Authorities handle the management of public airspace with support from the International Civil Aviation Organization. The “Regulations” section of the toolkit houses several international best practice documents for the safe management, monitoring and control of drone operations in public airspace.
