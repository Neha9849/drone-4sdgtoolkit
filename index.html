										label: "<p>“Reuse and Improve”.\nThe global drone industry has been developing for decades and the lessons learned from various stakeholders can be a guide for future innovation. UNICEF and several other stakeholders have made significant contributions to the global knowledge base of the technology and use of drones in the development and humanitarian contexts specifically. The “Guides” section is a collection of case studies, annual reports, and action guides for achieving specific outcomes.\nGuides Technical Guide - The use of drones in humanitarian and development missions\nThe use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) to support humanitarian and development operations must always consider the interests, perceptions and concerns of the people the mission aims to serve; and therefore should always adhere to the humanitarian imperative of doing no harm. Doing this will require assessment and mitigation of potential unintended consequences that UAS operations may have on affected communities and humanitarian action. UAS deployments in the humanitarian and development sector must observe the humanitarian ethical principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.\nThis guide is a summary of UNICEF’s intervention design process for drone interventions in humanitarian and development contexts.\nHow to use this tool: URL: https:\/\/unicef.github.io\/drone-4sdgtoolkit\/guide-drone-humanitarian-mission\nDownload the content and utilise freely as a tool; if the guide is used in developing new content, attribution will be appreciated.\nTechnical Guide – How to setup a humanitarian drone corridor\nA Humanitarian Drone Corridor is designed to provide a controlled land area and airspace for Government, the private sector, universities, and other partners to explore how drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), can help deliver services that benefit communities. Since 2015, UNICEF has invested in three (3) permanent Humanitarian Drone Corridors in Malawi, Kazakhstan, and Sierra Leone, and a temporary corridor during the drone vaccine delivery trials in Vanuatu.\nThe corridors have shown leadership in piloting drone use cases in medical deliveries, emergency response mapping, education mapping, and other applications. This document aims to provide a blueprint for establishing a humanitarian drone corridor based on the lessons learnt in the existing UNICEF corridors.\nThis guide is a summary of UNICEF’s approach for developing humanitarian drone corridors.\nHow to use this tool: URL: https:\/\/unicef.github.io\/drone-4sdgtoolkit\/guide-drone-corridor-setup\nDownload the content and utilise freely as a tool; if the guide is used in developing new content, attribution will be appreciated.\nTechnical Guide – Drones vs Satellite for Imagery Data\nToday, aerial imagery is available from a variety of sources, including traditional satellites, nano satellites, manned and unmanned aircrafts, balloons, and kites. This imagery can benefit humanitarian organisations in programme implementation, resource planning, community studies, and disaster response.\nPreviously, the process of developing maps from imagery was painstakingly slow and it required a great deal of time from highly technically skilled individuals to patch differently formatted images together.\nThis decision making guide aims to take the acquired knowledge from UNICEF’s use of satellites and drones for imagery collection and provide a guide on the different technologies as well as when to use a particular mode over the other.\nHow to use this tool: URL: https:\/\/unicef.github.io\/drone-4sdgtoolkit\/guide-satellite-vs-drone\nDownload the content and utilise freely as a tool; if the guide is used in developing new content, attribution will be appreciated.\nSubmit Guideline Documents to the UNICEF drones for SDGs toolkit –\nDo you have a guideline document that you have developed from completed research or interventions?\nJoin our efforts to make innovation for good more accessible and to scale impactful tools across the world.

The “Learning” section is a collection of drone technology learning resources. The courseware is from UNICEF drone education initiatives or open source courseware from other partners.\nLearning Tools Africa Drone and Data Academy\nThe African Drone and Data Academy (ADDA) aims to be a center of excellence that will equip African youth with necessary 21st-century skills while strengthening the drone ecosystem for more effective humanitarian and development response.\nThe ADDA courses, developed by Virginia Tech (USA) with the Malawi University of Science and Technology (Malawi) as its local partner, combines theoretical and practical methodologies in making, testing, and flying drones. The curriculum allows young people to learn how to construct and pilot drones, to integrate them into a supply chain system and to analyze drone data. It follows UNICEF’s ‘Drones and Data for Good’ vision, focusing on the potential of technology to positively impact young people.\nHow to use this tool: URL: https:\/\/adda-malawi.org\/courses#\nThe Remotely Piloted Aircraft Technology (RPAT) and Data Visualisation and Cartography (DVAC) are both self-paced online courses, available for anyone to enroll.\nSubmit Learning Tools to the UNICEF drones for SDGs toolkit – Do you have an open-source learning tool that you have developed?\nJoin our efforts to make innovation for good more accessible and to scale impactful tools across the world.

										value: "Regulations",
										label: "<p>“Build for sustainability” and “Do no harm”.\nDrones operate in public airspace, which is a very sensitive environment. This presents unique challenges and risks. National Civil Aviation Authorities handle the management of public airspace with support from the International Civil Aviation Organization. The “Regulations” section of the toolkit houses several international best practice documents for the safe management, monitoring and control of drone operations in public airspace.\nRegulation tools ICAO Model UAS Regulations\nThe ICAO Model UAS Regulations and companion Advisory Circulars (ACs) offer a template for Member States to implement or to supplement their existing UAS regulations. These regulations and ACs are intended to be a living document and will evolve as the industry matures, providing States and regulators with internationally harmonized material based on the latest developments.\nICAO encourages States who have implemented UAS regulations to share their regulations with ICAO by providing a link or PDF file to RPAS@icao.int. The State\u0026rsquo;s UAS Regulations will then be added to the repository of \u0026ldquo;Current State Regulations\u0026rdquo; located in the UAS Toolkit on ICAO\u0026rsquo;s public website: https:\/\/www.icao.int\/safety\/UA\/UASToolkit. As States enhance or expand their UAS regulations, they are urged to notify ICAO of these developments by providing a copy of their replacement UAS regulations.\nHow to use this tool: URL: https:\/\/www.icao.int\/safety\/UA\/Pages\/ICAO-Model-UAS-Regulations.aspx\nNavigate to the Model UAS Regulations page and download Part 101 and 102, as well as the companion advisory cirulars AC101-1, AC102-1, AC102-37, and Draft AC922-001. Use these documents as a framework to develop new National Civil Aviation UAS regulations.\nFor technical feedback in drafting new national regulations according to the ICAO Model UAS framework please contact RPAS@icao.int and drones.ooi@unicef.org.

The objective is to increase energy efficiency and improve performance of solar farms. The team also developed an agricultural use case, collecting and labelling aerial photos of crops which will be used to automatically detect diseases on crops.\nKey Results:\n Rentadrone has mapped 178 hectares of agricultural land, generating 24 maps for their relevant clients. Rentadrone has assessed 230,000 solar panels and found faults in 7150 panels increasing the efficiency of these clean energy alternatives  URL: https:\/\/rentadrone.cl\/ and https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/innovation\/venturefund\/dronescohort\/Rentadrone\nDronfies Labs\nCOUNTRY: Uruguay\nPARTNERS \u0026amp; COLLABORATORS: Pyxis Portal, SINAE (The National Emergency System- Uruguay), ANII (National Innovation Agency), DINACIA (Uruguayan Aeronautical Authorities) Project Description\nDronefies solutions provide support to drone operations during emergency situations such as natural disasters, compatible with a large variety of consumer drones.
